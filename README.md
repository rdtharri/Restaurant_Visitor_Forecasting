# Restaurant_Visitor_Forecasting
Code and Data for Recruit Holdings Kaggle Competition

ESM_Baseline.Rmd is the main submission file for the Kaggle competition. A kernel of that script can be found here:

The script aims to take only the time series data, the past visitors to the restaurants themselves, and predict future visitor information. 
The predictions do fairly well considering no cross-correlated variables are considered.
